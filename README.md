Kubernetes service demo app
===========================

Simple app that displays the pod id. Refresh the web page to see it change from one pod to the other.

It will also show a region identifier which needs to be added as an environment variable called REGION.
(Possible values currently are FRA or AMS).

You can add this variable through a configmap.
